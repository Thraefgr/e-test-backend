  Hi dear visitor!
  This the backend part of my class project called eTest!
  I suggest you download the frontend part and you will need MongoDB too!

  You will need to add a .env file and and need to add a few variables to it.
  
  # Variables:
  ## DB_URI=your mongodb connection string
  ## SECRET_KEY = your secure secret key
  ## PORT = 3001
  
  Note: PORT = 3001 is a must for frontend to be able to send requests to the proper port. (Although you could change frontend config file and use whatever port you want too!)
